Glasner 'deeply hopes' Guehi plays for Palace vs Villa amid Liverpool interest
Crystal PalacemanagerOliver Glasnersays he “deeply hopes” captainMarc Guehiwill play against Aston Villa on Sunday amid transfer interest fromLiverpool.
The England centre-back has been tracked by Liverpool this summer but played the full 90 minutes of Palace’s goalless draw against Norwegian side Fredrikstad in the second leg of their UEFA Conference League play-off.
Palace progressed thanks to their 1-0 victory at Selhurst Park last week despite an already thin squad missing several players and Glasner is desperate not to lose anyone else, having seen Eberechi Eze join Arsenal for an initial £60million this month.
“Everybody can see how many players we have available,” Glasner said in his post-match press conference. “Everybody can see how important Marc is. Honestly I don't know, but I really deeply hope Marc will play for us at Villa Park.""
Asked whether he expected Guehi to be with the club for the rest of the season, he repeated himself, saying “I deeply hope that Marc will play until the end of the season for us.”

Chelsea and Man Utd meet in the middle for Garnacho
Garnacho's move to Chelsea has been telegraphed all summer. The player told friends at the end of last season his desire was to move to London and Stamford Bridge would be his ideal destination. That targeted ambition hampered United's negotiating position, as did Ruben Amorim telling Garancho in front of teammates he would need to find a need club.
Some clubs were initially told of a £70m asking price but this reduced to £60m and when talks with Chelsea began United pressed for £50m. Chelsea, according to United sources, came in at £25m. They had started offers by suggesting only players in swap deals, none of whom were palatable to United.
Ultimately the two clubs have met in the middle for the 21-year-old, with United getting a guaranteed £40m plus a 10 per cent sell-on, which seems plausible to be triggered if Chelsea continue as they have been doing.
The sale marks the largest for a United academy graduate, and the fourth largest in United's history after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria. But it still will feel lower than what many fans would regard his value.
His departure will also be tinged with sadness for many, given his part in United's FA Youth Cup winning side of 2022, his explosive overhead kick at Goodison Park, and his goal in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2024. He did also upset supporters with some of his social media posts, not least posing in Marcus Rashford's Aston Villa shirt at the end of the last campaign.
Garnacho revelled under the spotlight of Old Trafford and wanted to stay, but came to realise his days were numbered in Amorim's system and the wider club ethos.
Chelsea agree deal with Manchester United for signing of Garnacho
Chelseahave agreed a deal withManchester Unitedfor the signing ofAlejandro Garnacho.
The deal consists of a £40million fixed fee and a 10 per cent sell-on clause is also included as part of the package.
Garnacho is set to sign a contract through to 2032 and is expected to undergo a medical on Friday ahead of the proposed move.

Spurs move for Nico Paz unlikely to materialise
Tottenham Hotspur’s interest in Nico Paz is unlikely to pan out this window. Como have received expressions of interest from the north London club that would value the player in excess of €70million.
But Paz, who has shone since joining the Italian side from Real Madrid for €6m last summer, is hopeful of returning to the Bernabeu next summer. Madrid have buy-back clauses in place for the 20-year-old, and next summer it would cost them €10m to bring him back based on the current terms, in which each club owns 50 per cent of his rights.
However, Como are trying to renegotiate the terms of the agreement, paying for a more significant percentage of Paz’s rights, with a higher buy-back clause for Madrid to pay next summer. Paz is happy to stay at Como for now, especially as it would provide him with stability before the 2026 World Cup, where he will be hoping to represent Argentina.
Leeds announce Patrick Bamford departure
Leeds Unitedhave announcedPatrick Bamfordwill leave the club this summer as a free agent.
Bamford, 31, had one year remaining on his deal but Leeds confirmed on Thursday a “mutual agreement” had been reached for his departure.
After his side’s pre-season draw with Manchester United on July 20, Leeds manager Daniel Farke said that Bamford would not be part of his plans for the coming season and that he had discussed the matter with the striker.
“The club became a massive part of my world, and I tried to make you proud by doing the most I could on the pitch and also in the community,” Bamford said in a video released on social media.
“Right now with the way it has come to an end and the way things have been handled recently, it’s all a little bit too raw to reflect on immediately.
""But I think in the years to come I’ll look back at this period of my life with nothing but joy, pride, and be super happy with what I’ve achieved and the fact that I was able to wear this number 9 shirt in front of you guys for this many years.”

What does Newcastle's Woltemade pursuit move mean for Isak?
Obviously, the question is: What does this mean for Alexander Isak's future?
The early soundings from the Newcastle end, at least as far as the coaches are concerned, is that Woltemade would be Callum Wilson's replacement, the attacker they have been looking for all summer regardless. He can play as an attacking midfielder or as a striker, and that versatility is attractive.
But that will not stop the speculation from mounting that this will potentially tempt Liverpool into making their long-anticipated second bid for Isak. What this means for Strand Larsen and Wissa at this stage is unclear, too, though Newcastle have been pessimistic about signing the latter for several weeks now.
Newcastle's summer striker search takes another turn
Can Newcastle finally land an expensive striker target? Or indeed any striker target, for that matter?
Bids were made for Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko and that trio ended up elsewhere. Brentford and Wolverhampton Wanderers have turned down multiple offers for Yoane Wissa and Jorgen Strand Larsen respectively.
But to have seemingly beaten Bayern Munich to a player of Woltemade's quality and potential is extremely encouraging. As of a week ago, Newcastle did not feel a deal was possible. That has changed dramatically in the days since, with Newcastle's recruitment team spinning multiple plates on the striker front.
Newcastle closing in on for Stuttgart forward Woltemade
Newcastle United are closing in on a deal for Stuttgart forward Nick Woltemade.
The Premier League side are in negotiations with their German counterparts as they seek to add a forward to their squad.
Woltemade, 23, had an excellent season for Stuttgart in 2024-25, scoring 17 times across 33 matches, and was top scorer at this summer’s European Under-21 Championship with six goals.

Isaac Schmidt, Largie Ramazani both leave Leeds on loan
Full-back Isaac Schmidt and winger Largie Ramazani have both left Leeds United on loan and joined Werder Bremen and Valencia respectively.
The Athleticreported earlier today that both players were undergoing medicals at their new clubs.
Schmidt joined from Swiss side St. Gallen last summer but only made nine starts for Leeds as he struggled for game time.
Ramzani also joined the club last summer, arriving from Spanish team Almeria. He made 32 appearances in all competitions in the 2024-25 campaign but only started 10 games.
Who could be leaving Newcastle before the end of the window?
The future of Jamaal Lascelles, the Newcastle club captain who missed the whole of last season with an ACL injury, is uncertain. The 31-year-old is in the final 12 months of his deal and was left out of the squad for Villa. Following Malick Thiaw’s arrival, he is fifth-choice centre-half and an exit has not been ruled out.
Newcastle would not stand in the way of full-back Harrison Ashby leaving, while Matt Targett has joined Championship club Middlesbrough on loan.
Osula is attracting loan interest from Europe, but the 22-year-old will definitely not be allowed to go unless at least one striker is signed. Even then, Howe would prefer to have greater depth at his disposal.

Do Championship sales figures explain why promoted clubs are willing to spend?
Tyler Dibling’s £35million move from Southampton to Everton pushed player sales by Championship clubs to just shy of £300m this summer, making the division the sixth-highest selling league in world football, behind Europe’s ‘big five’.
Despite that, sales are down currently; in each of the last two summers, second-tier clubs earned over £400m from player transfers.
That in part stems from fewer sales to the division that many Championship clubs aspire to be in.
After Dibling’s move, Premier League sides have spent £143m on Championship players this summer. Excluding a Covid-hit 2021, that’s an eight-year low.
Fees may be reduced, but where they end up remains constant. Recently relegated clubs hoover up most of the money from player sales, and this summer 72 per cent of fees have pooled in the coffers of Ipswich Town, Leicester City, Southampton and Sheffield United, the four clubs in receipt of parachute payments.

Guehi starts Palace's Conference League play-off second leg
Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi has started the side's Conference League play-off second leg against Norwegian club Fredrikstad.
Oliver Glasner's have a 1-0 lead heading into the match after Jean-Philippe Mateta scored Palace's first ever European goal at Selhurst Park last week.
Guehi has one year left on his contract and his future at the club is unclear. Liverpool held talks with Palace over a move for the England international.
However, Glasner has confirmed that he remains in communication with Guehi and that the defender is committed to helping the team.
""It’s very important [he's playing],"" Glasner told Channel 5 before kick-off. ""I’m speaking to Marc almost every day and it was clear he would play this game in Norway and then let’s see what will come. But I know that I can rely on Marc and count on him.""

Dan Ndoye already making his mark at Forest
In his opening games forNottingham Forest, it is fitting that the man who learnt English by watching the Harry Potter films has already produced two moments of magic.
Dan Ndoye, who arrived at Forest as replacement forAnthony Elanga, followed up an old-school diving header goal on his debut in the 3-1 win overBrentfordby conjuring up a sublime, defence-splitting pass to sendCallum Hudson-Odoithrough to score the equaliser atCrystal Palace.
From the moment he briefly became the club’s record transfer — before the arrival ofOmari HutchinsonfromIpswich Towntwo weeks later — when he moved fromBolognafor £35million ($47.1m), Ndoye has been a character who has lifted the mood at the club with his positive outlook and constant smile.
“I just try to be myself,” the 24-year-old explains to a group of journalists in pre-season. “Elanga did a great job when he was here, but I will do the best I can. I am a different player. I want to bring my own quality, as much as I can.”

Newcastle target Wissa will miss Sunderland trip - Andrews
Brentford head coach Keith Andrews says Newcastle target Yoane Wissa will again sit out Saturday's visit to newly-promoted Sunderland.
Wissa has not featured for Brentford this season as he agitates for a move to St. James' Park, but Newcastle's most recent bid, worth £35million plus £5m in difficult-to-achieve add-ons, was turned down by Brentford last week.
""Copy and paste from the other day,"" Andrews said when asked about Wissa's future at the London club. ""The exact same answer, nothing has changed in terms of my stance. In terms of movement behind the scenes, I don't see any movement on that so it's the same as it was.""
Asked if Wissa would feature at the Stadium of Light, Andrews said: ""No, again, similar to the other day [I'll] focus on the group that is settled and not got issues that are ongoing. Which clearly Yoane has, so the squad will be pretty much the same as the other night.""
Aston Villa and Unai Emery’s need for fresh faces
Aston Villa's Unai Emeryis one several Premier League managers to state that they expected more from this transfer window.
“The first reason now why we are missing something other in our squad is because some players left one week or two weeks ago when we were expecting to do deals before,” Emery acknowledged last week.
Multiple sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, have toldThe Athleticfor the past month that Villa’s transfer incomings this summer would likely transpire in the final week of the window, provided they had the financial scope to make signings.
Villa have been offered players in recent days, discussed potential loans and are evaluating whether deals for long-standing targets such asMarco AsensioandNicolas Jacksoncould happen, under the right financial constraints.

Will Harvey Elliott leave Anfield this summer?
Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott continues to be linked with a move away from the club.
The Athleticreported interest from RB Leipzig, while there are also suitors in the Premier League and elsewhere. Given that Liverpool do not have a plethora of players in Elliott’s position, it is not certain he will go.
But many are watching the England Under-21 attacker, and he will want more game time this season than last, so a move remains plausible.
